   <h1>Hello World!</h1>

   <p>Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like this city 
    Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit P-diddy (let's go)
    Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
    <br>
    
    <p>'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't comin' back
    I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
    Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
    Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
    Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
    Pullin' up to the parties, tryna get a little bit tipsy</p>
